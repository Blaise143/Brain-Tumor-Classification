# Brain-Tumor-Detection (98% Accurate)
In this project, I used a residual neural-network on brain scan data to create a model that, given a brain scan image, can predict whether or not the image has a brain tumor. 
## Concepts used in this project:
  #### Deep Learning
    - Convolutional Neural Networks
    - Residual Neural Networks
  #### Data Visualization:
    - Matplotlib
## How to recreate the results in this project:
  - Download the dataset used in this project from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/preetviradiya/brian-tumor-dataset?datasetId=1343913&select=Brain+Tumor+Data+Set)
  - put the dataset in a folder called `Brain Tumor Dataset` and put it in the same directory as the files in this repository
  - Download all the dependencies namely: `Tensorflow`, `matplotlib`, `pandas` and `numpy`
  - Open the `Resnet.ipynb` file and run the cells.

## Potential Improvements to this project
  - Setting a learning rate decay
  - Adding a regularization such as a drop out layer after a convolution block or an identity block

# HAPPY CODING!!!
